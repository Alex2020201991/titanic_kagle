**This is one of the most popular projects for Data Scientist beginners. We will dive into the tragedy of the Titanic.**
**In this challenge, we are going to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).**
**In this project we used data visualization and machine learning.**!
